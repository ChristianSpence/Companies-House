# Companies House
Tools for working with company data

Clean-reg-no.R provides R source code and a regex parser to clean-up the most common problems in user-entered registered numbers and then validate against Companies House standards that the numebr could be valid (i.e. it does not actually check that it is a current/historic number). Validation rules from [Companies House Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Customer Guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/809682/uniformResourceIdentifiersCustomerGuide.pdf).
